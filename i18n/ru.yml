bio:
 thomas: "<p>Thomas Leuthard is a Swiss based street content-element who travels around the World to witness and document life on the streets.</p><p>For him the best places to shoot street is the railway station of a big city.</p><p>The reason for this might by his childhood where he was ground up at a small railway station in the center of Switzerland. It's not the trains or the technology which fascinates him, it's the daily life and the variety of people passing such a place.</p>"
 bjorn: "<p>Björn Bechstein is a content-element currently living in Frankfurt/Germany. His passion is travelling the world, which made him strive to capture the diversity and natural beauty of people. As aestethics and composition play a big role for him, he takes his time for his photographs and increasingly uses analogue technology.</p>"
 fokko: "<p>Born in Rotterdam 1957, living in drenthe, the Netherlands. Married, has son and daughter. Works as ict consultant. </p><p>Discovered street photography since end of 2010. Shooting on panasonic dmc-gx1 and iPhone.</p>"
 fernando: "<p>I'm a recent Portuguese amateur street content-element going to the streets of Lisbon looking for the decisive moments, mainly humorous or ironic.</p><p>Being a chemical engineer and consultant on the field of water treatment,  I have photography as a hobby for a long time and I normally was focused on shooting macro and landscapes with my EOS 7D, heavy lens (Sigma EX 17-50mmm) and heavy tripod. During that period I got some recognition on some posting sites and Portuguese photo magazines, but I never was totally satisfied or engaged with 'my' hobby.</p><p>I discovered street photography in the beginning of 2012 and since May, after I made a street photo workshop in Lisbon centre and brought my light and versatile Fujifilm X10, I never stopped shooting and I usually be able to produced and post a rewarding street shoot every day. On my view the main advantages of street photography is that if you feel on the right mod to start shooting and have the luck of living on a busy place like Lisbon you only need to go out and making it happen. You always have amazing characters, scenes, places at you disposable if you make use of some clever techniques, and more important, train your eye a make time available to be focus and engaged with the so much that is always surround you.</p><p>My main inspirations are <a href='http://ruipalha.fineart-portugal.com'>Rui Palha</a>  and <a href='http://500px.com/85mm'>Thomas Leuthard</a>. The first because most of his photos are made in Lisbon (my own city) and because most of his photos are really masterpieces where street photography meets fine art, and the second because of his amazing gift to «collecting» souls with his street portraits, cool street scenes and, of course, his fantastic e-books that were to me an enormous source of inspiration and street techniques.</p><p>Has I first said, my photos try to capture street scenes that catch my eye and hopefully the eye and attention of my viewers, being most of the time humorous scenes, ironic or about interesting characters on their living environment. Recently I engaged a project that I named «Mr.» Series, in which I normally use a low PoV and close subject distance to try to catch and read his/her toughs and interpret his/her behaviour. Based on my interpretation I give a name to the «Mr.» ;)</p>"
 martin: "<p>I've started with photography about eleven years ago when I was sixteen. Back then, I had no idea what really matters in photography. It was the work of the old masters like Robert Doisneau, Henri Cartier-Bresson or Willy Ronis that lured me to street photography.</p><p>Their work taught me that there is more about street photography than just black and white pictures of the street. Street photography is not random, it's decisive. It is about being at the right place at the right time. To catch those moments that are crucial in otherwise random environment. To find moments that would be otherwise buried in everyday situations. I document the life on the streets as they are. In the streets, you have all the time in the world and yet only few splits of a second will be remembered. It's just you, your eye and your camera. Everything else is just your stage, everyone else is just an actor playing a role in your document.</p><p>In street photography, there is the clue of reality. Reality cannot be photographed nor it can be objectively perceived by anyone, but in street photography there is a small clue. It is not even a primary objective of street photography and yet it is there. Like a puzzle that completes an image.</p><p>As a street content-element, I want to capture decisive moments. Form is not important; it's the content that matters. I'm not trying to take a perfect shot, but I want my photos to be clear and easily absorbed. I'm not an artist, I'm a storyteller. Like Elliot Erwitt said: «the whole point of taking pictures is so that you don't have to explain things in words».</p>"

bio:
 thomas:<p>Thomas Leuthard is a Swiss based street content-element who travels around the World to witness and document life on the streets. </p>For him the best places to shoot street is the railway station of a big city.<p>The reason for this might by his childhood where he was ground up at a small railway station in the center of Switzerland. It's not the trains or the technology which fascinates him, it's the daily life and the variety of people passing such a place.</p>
